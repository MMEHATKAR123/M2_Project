Project Name:-Third Eye for The Blind using ATmega328<br>
  <h2>
  ABOUT THIS PROJECT<br>
    <h4>
      1)The Third Eye for Blind is designed to help the blind to overcome the lack of visual sense, by using other senses like sound and touch It uses audio and vibration signals to notify the user about upcoming hurdle. As the distance between glove and obstacle decreases, frequency of both audio and vibration signals increases.. Thus the system helps to ease the navigation process for the needy.<br>
      <h4>
        2)The system uses Atmega-328 microcontroller, which is a high performance 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller.It also has features like, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers and three adjustable timer/counters with compare modes.For sensing the distance the system uses a HC-SR04, a Ultrasonic Range Finder Distance Sensor Module. The sensor module is designed to measure the distance using the principle of SONAR or RADAR, of using ultrasonic wave to determine the distance of an object. The system also consist a buzzer to generate an alarm sound and a motor to generate vibration signals.
